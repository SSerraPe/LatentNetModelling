# LatentNetModelling
A collection of tools and experiments focused on inferring latent structures in complex networks. This repo explores probabilistic models such as Latent Space Models (LSM) and Stochastic Block Models (SBM) to uncover hidden patterns in relational data. Includes Bayesian inference implementations, MCMC sampling, and visualization utilities in R
